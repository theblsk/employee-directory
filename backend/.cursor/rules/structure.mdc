This project will use the route -> controller -> service -> repository architecture.

we will use camelCase naming convetion with fullName.whatItIs.ts convention. (eg. employee.controller.ts)

# Routes
There is a default index.ts route file which will import employee routes and department routes and export them to be used in the index.ts launch file

# Controllers & Services & Repositories

Each file will have CRUD operation functions calling each other, then the controller entry point is called by the route in the appropriate route file.
